    <h1>Java compilers</h1>
    <p>In General a compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language.</p>
    <p>A Java compiler is a program that takes the text file work of a developer and compiles it into a platform-independent Java file. Java compilers include the Java Programming Language Compiler (javac), the GNU Compiler for Java (GCJ), the Eclipse Compiler for Java (ECJ) and  Jikes.</p>

    <h2>javac</h2>
    <p>
        javac is the compiler which you get by default with JDK.
    </p>
    <p>
        To compile a Java file with javac, we need to run the command "javac file_name.java" on terminal. It compiles the java program and displays if there's any error and creates a file with name "file_name.class" with bytecosde in it.
    </p>

    <h2>Java Platform Components</h2>
    <p>There are three platform Components in Java</p>
    <ul>
        <li>JDK</li>
        <li>JRE</li>
        <li>JVM</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <h2>JDK</h2>
    <p>The JDK is a collection of software tools that you can use for developing Java applications. You can set up the JDK in your development environment by downloading and installing it. Select the JDK software version that matches the Java version you want to use. For example, Java Standard Edition, or Java SE, requires the Java SE JDK.</p>
    <h2>JRE</h2>
    <p>The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is software that Java programs require to run correctly. Java is a computer language that powers many current web and mobile applications. The JRE is the underlying technology that communicates between the Java program and the operating system. It acts as a translator and facilitator, providing all the resources so that once you write Java software, it runs on any operating system without further modifications.</p>
    <h2>JVM</h2>
    <p>The JVM is software that runs the Java program line by line. Developers configure the JVM settings to manage program resources when the Java application runs. For example, you can change the JVM memory setting and check how much internal memory your Java applications use at runtime.</p>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: JVM and javac are the part of JDK</p>
